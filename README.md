# Ravenpack frontend assignment

### Description

With this task we would like you to create a simple blog post reading application using React and JSONPlaceholder. JSONPlaceholder is a publicly available API that provides various read-only endpoints, more information can be found on their website: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.

### Base Requirements

- I should be able to browse a list of all existing posts.

- I should be able to view a single post as well as any comments for that post.

- I should be able to see all posts by a given user.

### Tech To Use

The only mandatory library for this task is React, apart from that you are free to use any publicly available library you like. Some of the tech we like to use: TypeScript, Tanstack query, MUI, react testing library, axios, vite, prettier, eslint, tailwind, date-fns.

Please note that while this task is focused on the code, care should also be taken with the site design.

## Implementation

### Overview

I decided to implement this using Vite and a very basic structure since the project is very simple.
To avoid dealing with too much error handling, `axios` was used as a library for dealing with the API.

### How to run

To test it locally, simply clone and run `yarn dev` in the component after installing. It will be running on `localhost:5173`

### Deployment

The application is also deployed on Render and can be found on https://ravenpack-assignment.onrender.com
